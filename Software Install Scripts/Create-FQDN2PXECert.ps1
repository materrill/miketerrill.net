.SYNOPSIS
    PowerShell script to reset certificates and a create a FQDN self-signed certificate
.DESCRIPTION
    This script will check the 2PXE self-signed certificates for the FQDN name of the system and will delete them
    It will then stop the 2PXE service, remove the 2PXE self-signed certificate files from ProgramData, edit the 2PXE config file,
    and then start the 2PXE service to generate a new FQDN self-signed certificate
    It verifies the import, and handles common errors.
